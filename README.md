# Telegram Bot

This is a Telegram bot which works like a _restricted mail group_ where only admins can send messages directly. When a regular user sends a message (via `/suggest <link>`) it's moderated by admins. If a suggestion by a regular user is accepted then it becomes a message otherwise it's ignored and only be seen by admins. Just like a mail group, all messages are delivered to all users.

Purpose of this bot is to create a medium where people can receive a curated stream of technological updates.

# Deployment

You can fork and create your own bot. Only thing you need to do is to create a bot via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and then use its token.

Following environment variables are required:

* `BASE_URL` - **without a trailing slash**
* `TOKEN` - 
* `MONGO_URI`

To test in local environment you need to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) which is an application that exposes your local ip to a globally reachable temporary domain name so that you can receive Telegram's webhook request while running on `localhost`.
